# 🚀 Custom XAMPP Dashboard Branch

This branch is dedicated to ✨ **customizing** the original XAMPP dashboard to align with the specific needs of my project. The goal is to replace the default XAMPP dashboard with a personalized version, while keeping the folder structure neat and organized to facilitate project management.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
htdocs
├── dashboard
│   ├── [Original XAMPP Files]
│   └── index.html        # 🖥️ Main customized dashboard file
├── projects
│   ├── project1          # 📁 Folder for Project 1 files
│   └── project2          # 📁 Folder for Project 2 files
└── index.php             # 🌐 Root index file (optional)
```

### 🔑 Key Components:
- **dashboard/index.html**: 🖥️ The main custom dashboard file that replaces the default XAMPP dashboard. It is tailored to provide quick access to my specific projects and resources.
- **projects/**: 📁 A directory to organize multiple projects, each in its own folder (e.g., `project1`, `project2`), ensuring clear separation and easy management.
- **index.php**: 🌐 An optional root-level file that could be used for additional custom routing or to serve as a central point for all projects.

### 🎯 Purpose:
- **Custom Dashboard**: The new dashboard is designed to streamline navigation and project management, making it easy to access various development projects or tools relevant to the workflow.
- **Original XAMPP Files**: 🔧 Essential files from the original XAMPP dashboard are retained to ensure the core functionality remains intact while allowing for customization on top of it.

This structure provides flexibility for organizing multiple projects under a single XAMPP installation, with a central dashboard 🚀 for easy access to those projects.
